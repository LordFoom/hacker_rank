 * Place N Cameras Without Conflict on Blocked Grid

Given an NxN grid where 0 is empty and 1 is blocked, return true if N cameras can be placed on empty cells such that no two share the same row, column, or diagonal.
Examples
Example 1

Input:
N = 4
grid = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Output:
True

Explanation:
    We need to place 4 cameras so that no two share a row, column, or diagonal. One valid arrangement is:
        Row 0 → column 1
        Row 1 → column 3
        Row 2 → column 0
        Row 3 → column 2
    Each row has exactly one camera, no two are in the same column, and no two lie on the same diagonal. Thus the function returns true.

Example 2
Input:
N = 4
grid = [[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]

Output:
True

Explanation:
    Some cells are blocked by skylights (marked 1).
    We still need 4 cameras. One possible placement:
        Row 0 → column 2 (cell [0][2] is empty)
        Row 1 → column 0 (cell [1][0] is empty, no conflict with row 0)
        Row 2 → column 3 (cell [2][3] is empty, no conflicts)
        Row 3 → column 1 (cell [3][1] is empty, no conflicts)
    All cameras are on empty cells, and none share a row, column, or diagonal.
    The function returns true.

Input Format

    The first line contains a single integer, N.
    The second line contains a single integer, grid_rows, representing the number of rows in the grid.
    The third line contains a single integer, grid_columns, representing the number of columns in the grid.
    The next grid_rows lines describe the grid. Each of these lines contains grid_columns space-separated integers.

5

4
1 0 0 1
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0

Explanation:

    N = 5
    grid_rows = 3
    grid_columns = 4
    grid = [[1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0]]

Constraints

    1 <= N <= 15
    grid.length == N
    For all 0 <= i < N, grid[i].length == N
    For all 0 <= i, j < N, grid[i][j] ∈ {0, 1}

Output Format

Return a single boolean value (true or false) indicating whether a valid arrangement of N cameras exists under the given constraints.
